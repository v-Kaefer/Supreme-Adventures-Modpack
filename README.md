# Supreme Adventures Modpack
 Modded Minecraft for Supreme Adventures


After watching [Lunar's Modloaders Series](youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSnKfKBtUECNFJit8mP2FnTjku0kbRrCT&si=hEyqtEyulBJbF6vV)
I decided to use Forge for my first modpack.


### Requested Mods and Vote Counts

## How to Request a Mod

To request a mod, please open an issue using the [Mod Request Template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/mod_request_template.md).

## Automation

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automate the process of handling mod requests, verifying them, and updating the mod list and votes.
All you need to do, is open an issue with the mod_request preset! Then, either the mod will be added to the mods_list.md or be counted as a vote for said mod, to be reviewed and possibly added to the modpack.
